Hi! I'm Paulus
I come from a business and accounting background, and after a few years working in that space, I made the jump into software development to build things that actually solve problems.
I understand how companies operate and how to build tools that help them run better or align the product idea witch tech.

Over the past 3 years, Iâ€™ve been immersed in computer science and back-end development, starting with low-level programming in Câ€”covering memory management, pointers, system calls, and building tools from scratch. 
I then advanced into C++, learning about object-oriented programming, multi threading, data structures and algorithms and networks.
Since then, Iâ€™ve built over 20 projects, including full-stack web apps, backend APIs, data analysis pipelines, and system-level tools,
but lately my focus has been on networking and web back-end technologies. 
Iâ€™ve worked on projects involving sockets, HTTP, RESTful APIs, and built real-world systems using Python (Django), PostgreSQL, Redis, Docker, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, and NGINX. 
Through this, I gained experience with virtualization, web servers, and back-end architecture.
