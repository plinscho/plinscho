I learned C as my first programming language, which gave me a deep understanding of how computers work at a low level — from memory management and pointers to system calls and process communication. 
This foundation has helped me build a strong mental model of how software interactsat low level, and allowed me to better understand operating systems, networking, and backend systems.

## 🚀 About Me

- 💻 I'm currently studying at **42 Barcelona**, where I’ve completed over 20 software projects — from low-level C to full-stack web apps.
- 🧠 I thrive in backend environments: databases, APIs, real-time logic, authentication, architecture.
- ⚙️ I love **breaking down complex systems** and making them scalable, secure, and maintainable.
- 📚 Passionate about clean code, system design, and continuous learning.
